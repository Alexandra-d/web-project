<p> I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk">Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only 8 weeks!
Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why...

HTML is cool
CSS is cooler
Hi
JS is the best</p>

<h2> <em> What do you need to create a website?</em> </h2>

<p> Not much!
A computer (always a good start)
A text editor (I am using atom)
A web browser (I am using chrome)
Some HTML, CSS and JS files</p>
